## 1. Project Overview

TravelTide, a growing e-booking platform for flights and hotels, is facing challenges with **customer retention**. To address this, the Head of Marketing, *Elena Tarrant*, is developing a **personalised rewards program** aimed at increasing repeat usage.

This segmentation analysis was conducted to support the initiative with the following core tasks:

- Analyze customer behavior data to define meaningful segments.
- Identify overlaps between segments.
- Recommend tailored perks for each group.

---

## 2. Business Context & Challenges

### 🟢 Opportunities

- Clear segmentation potential from user behavior patterns.
- Ability to enhance personalization through data-driven perks.

### 🔴 Limitations

- Segment overlap complicates perk targeting (e.g., business travelers who are also high spenders).
- Data anomalies (e.g., unreliable airport codes, zero-night hotel stays).
- Session data is limited to users with **more than 7 sessions** from **Jan–Jul 2023**.

---

## 3. Segmentation Strategy

Customers were segmented based on behavioral indicators such as flight/hotel activity, use of discounts, family size, etc. A **decision-tree logic** was applied to assign users into one of **seven distinct segments**.

---

## 4. Key Findings

- **25% overlap** between *Business Travelers* and *High Spenders*.
- Significant cross-segment users → a **flexible loyalty model** is needed.
- “**Dreamers**” represent a large untapped opportunity.
- Segments like “Family with Kids” may not warrant dedicated treatment due to small size.

---

## 5. Recommendations & Next Steps

### 🔍 Test & Evaluate

- A/B test perks, starting with the *Business Traveler* group.
- Measure uplift in **retention**, **conversion**, and **ROI**.

### 💡 Enhance Loyalty Design

- Introduce **TravelTide Points (TT Points)** – a universal currency based on spend and engagement.
- Allow users to **opt into multiple loyalty paths** to accommodate segment overlaps.

### 🔎 Conduct Qualitative Research

- Use **user panels** to understand why some customers browse but don’t book.
- Use insights to refine segmentation and perk logic.
