## TravelTide Customer Segmentation Analytics Prepared by Dean Eyre – 16 May 2025

### 1. Project Overview
TravelTide, a growing e-booking platform offering flights and hotel bookings, faces challenges with customer retention. To address this, the Head of Marketing, Elena Tarrant, is designing a personalized rewards program aimed at increasing repeat usage.
To support this initiative, a customer segmentation analysis was conducted with the following core tasks:
> Analyze customer behavior data to define meaningful segments.
> Identify potential overlaps between segments.
> Recommend tailored perks for each group.

### 2. Business Context & Challenges
Opportunities:
> Clear segmentation potential from user behavior patterns.
> Ability to enhance personalization through data-driven perks.
Limitations:
> Segment overlap complicates perk targeting (e.g., business travelers who are also high spenders).
> Data anomalies in the source set (e.g., unreliable airport codes, zero-night hotel stays).
> Session data limited to users with more than 7 sessions from Jan–Jul 2023.

### 3. Segmentation Strategy
> Customers were categorized using behavioral indicators (flights, hotels, discounts, family size, etc.). A decision-tree logic was applied to assign users to one of seven distinct segments:
Segment Definitions & Recommended Perks




### 4. Key Findings
> Business Travelers and High Spenders overlap significantly (approx. 25%).
> Many users fit into multiple segments, indicating the need for a flexible loyalty model.
> “Dreamers” are a large untapped opportunity if incentivized properly.
> Some segments, like “Family with Kids,” may not justify separate treatment due to size.

### 5. Recommendations & Next Steps
🔍 Test & Evaluate
> A/B test perks, starting with the Business Traveler group.
> Measure whether perk-based segmentation improves retention, conversion, and ROI.
💡 Enhance Loyalty Design
> Consider introducing TravelTide Points (TT Points) – a universal currency for perks based on spend and engagement.
> Allow users to opt in to multiple loyalty paths if they fall into overlapping segments.
🔎 Conduct Qualitative Research
> Engage with user panels to understand why some customers browse but don’t book.
> Use findings to refine segmentation logic and perks.

### Conclusion
Segmentation at TravelTide reveals actionable insights for personalized marketing and retention strategies. The next phase should focus on testing impact and refining the loyalty model to be dynamic, flexible, and customer-centric.
